Hive Plot
=========

The `hive plot` is a visualization method for drawing networks. Nodes
are mapped to and positioned on radially distributed linear axes — this
mapping is based on network structural properties. Edges are drawn as curved
links. Simple and interpretable.

The purpose of the hive plot is to establish a new baseline for visualization
of large networks — a method that is both general and tunable and useful as a
starting point in visually exploring network structure.

Sample Visualizations
