Arc Diagram
===========

An arc diagram is a style of graph drawing, in which the vertices of a graph
are placed along a line in the Euclidean plane, with edges being drawn as
semicircles in one of the two halfplanes bounded by the line, or as smooth
curves formed by sequences of semicircles. In some cases, line segments of the
line itself are also allowed as edges, as long as they connect only vertices
that are consecutive along the line.

The use of the phrase "arc diagram" for this kind of drawings follows the use
of a similar type of diagram by Wattenberg (2002) to visualize the repetition
patterns in strings, by using arcs to connect pairs of equal substrings.
However, this style of graph drawing is much older than its name, dating back
to the work of Saaty (1964) and Nicholson (1968), who used arc diagrams to
study crossing numbers of graphs. An older but less frequently used name for
arc diagrams is `linear embeddings`.

Heer, Bostock & Ogievetsky wrote that arc diagrams "may not convey the overall
structure of the graph as effectively as a two-dimensional layout", but that
their layout makes it easy to display multivariate data associated with the
vertices of the graph.
