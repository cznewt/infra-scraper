Adjacency Matrix
================

An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The
elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not
in the graph.

In the special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a
(0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal. If the graph is undirected, the
adjacency matrix is symmetric. The relationship between a graph and the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix is studied in spectral
graph theory.

The adjacency matrix should be distinguished from the incidence matrix for a
graph, a different matrix representation whose elements indicate whether
vertex–edge pairs are incident or not, and degree matrix which contains
information about the degree of each vertex.
