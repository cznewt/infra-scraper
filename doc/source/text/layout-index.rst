Visualization Layouts
=====================

Diagrams are symbolic representation of information according to some
visualization technique. Diagrams have been used since ancient times, but
became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses
a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-
dimensional surface. The word `graph` is sometimes used as a synonym for
`diagram`.
