============================
Force-Directed Edge Bundling
============================

Danny Holten presents an awesome and aesthetically pleasing way of simplifying
graphs and making tree graphs more accessible.  What makes his project so
useful, however, is how he outlines the particular thought process that goes
into making a visualization. Holten concludes that by using bundles, not only
are graphs more accessible, but the creator can have more control over the
amount of information, as well as the information level being presented.


Sample Visualizations
=====================
